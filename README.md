# CloudLink

CloudLink is an API for Scratch 3. It's basically cloud variables, but better.

## How it works

CloudLink connects to a hosted server, either on the localhost or through a port forwarded static ip or a reverse proxy such as ngrok. The client is a [Eç¾Šicques](https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/) extension, and all that is needed is to add the extension, and an internet connection (if not using the localhost).

## View the wiki page for documentation on how to use the server.py program and the extension.
